# Precourse Section 1

These are the tasks you should aim to complete in your first 1-2 weeks doing the Precourse. You can switch between them - don't feel you have to complete everything in order, especially if you're having issues with one particular problem.

### Basic Skills

You've probably already demonstrated in your tech test that you know how to handle these situation, but make sure you are absolutely confident with them as they will underpin everything you do in JavaScript in this Precourse and beyond.

* Store a value as a variable
* Execute code conditionally ('if' something is true)
* Access an item in an array if you know its index
* Access a value of an object if you know its key
* Iterate through an array or string
* Create a function with parameters that returns a value
* Execute a function with parameters
* Log values to the console

### Problem Solving

Problem solving is the number one skill that employers in the tech sector value - good problem solvers are able to work in any language, technology or situation.

Please watch [these 5 videos by Michael Starbird](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT). The first two in particular really chime with the Northcoders philosophy. Try to apply what you have learnt in these videos to the next coding problems you encounter.

If you haven't already done so, please work through some of the [Algorithm Challenges on FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting). All of the problems in this chapter are excellent practice - we recommend trying to solve 5 of them as a minimum.

### Codewars

There are lots of sites that offer katas (self-contained coding problems) for you to sharpen your problem-solving skills. One of the most important things you can do is get as much practise problem-solving with JavaScript as possible.

Sign up with [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/LwRQbA) and email us at[precourse@northcoders.com](mailto:precourse@northcoders.com) to let us know your account name so we can track your progress, if you haven't already. You should be aiming to complete level 8, 7 and 6 katas to put into practise what you are learning in the Precourse.  You should aim to have 200 points before you start the Developer Pathway. Take the opportunity to look at other people's solutions - but remember, the shortest isn't necessarily the best. Clarity should always be your number one concern.

Here are some recommended Codewars katas to get you started.

 - [Max and Min Values](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-maximum-and-minimum-values-of-a-list)
 - [Miles per gallon to kilometers per liter](http://www.codewars.com/kata/miles-per-gallon-to-kilometers-per-liter)
 - [Find nth Digit](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-nth-digit-of-a-number)

 - [Product of largest pair](http://www.codewars.com/kata/product-of-largest-pair)
 - [Palindrome strings](http://www.codewars.com/kata/palindrome-strings)

Whilst doing this, you should start to use built-in JavaScript methods - functions that have already been implemented for common issues in programming that you can apply to a type of value, like an array or object. If you find yourself writing code likely to be useful in a lot of situations, check if a method exists for this already. The place to go to read about built-in methods is the MDN documentation. Here are a few useful methods to get you started:

- [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) / [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)
- [toString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)
- [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
- [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)
- [reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)
- [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)
- [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
- [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed)

### The Command Line

Please read [this article](http://learntocodewith.me/getting-started/topics/command-line/) that explains why we use the command line.

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) on using the command line. Follow the whole course up to the end, completing the exercises. Code Academy also has [more practice material](https://codeacademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on the command line if you want to use this in addition.

Print out or bookmark this [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) of common commands. The directories and files commands are most useful so try to practice with these and commit them to memory as soon as possible.

From now onwards, try to **always** use your terminal program (iTerm, Hyper, Terminator or git bash) to navigate around your computer, make, move, copy or remove files and folders.

### Git / Github

Version control is a necessity in modern-day programming. Git and Github are big topics and we will explore them during the course in more detail, but they will be part of your daily workflow from day 1, so take some time to begin to learn how they work.

Make sure you have installed git (revisit the Install Guide if necessary) and that we have your Github account details.

For a basic introduction to Git and Github, please watch videos 1-7 of [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Try out git yourself by following the GitHub Learning Lab course at the bottom of this page of the [GitHib Learning Resources](https://try.github.io/).

You will need to use Git to download this repository so that you can complete the final challenges!

### Challenges

There are two sets of challenges attached to this section. The first are aimed at ensuring you understand the different types of values there are in JavaScript, and some of their attached methods. The second are to test your problem solving skills, using what you've learnt about JavaScript logic creatively.

These videos demonstrate the workflow required to get, solve and submit the final challenges. There's step-by-step instructions below too - this will put your skills with the command line and git to the test, alongside JavaScript problem solving.

[Forking and cloning the project](https://youtu.be/QxvgzQFmOJE)

[Solving a problem](https://youtu.be/8r2DrCwKPRY)

Please note that the arrangement of the files has changed a bit since we recorded this video. Follow the guide below when ensuring you are in the right directory to run `npm install` and `npm test`.

[Pushing and committing your code](https://youtu.be/WkZvpDnphqE)

1. Fork and clone this repository as seen in the video below.

2. `cd` into the repository.

3. Run `npm install` in your terminal.

3.5. If you've not done so already, be sure to install mocha globally by running `npm install -g mocha` in your terminal.

4. Run `npm test` in your terminal to see the test suite. You will see lots of red - that's good!

5. Open the index.js challenge file in VS Code and begin solving them.

6. Run the test suite regularly using `npm test` to see how you are doing.

7. If you stall on one problem and want to move on, you'll find that the tests will end at the last incorrect challenge. To allow the test suite to move on, open the index file in the spec folder. Find the describe block for the function you are currently writing, and place an x before it, like this:

```js
xdescribe('getLastWord', () => {
  it('returns the last word of the passed sentence', () => {
    expect(getLastWord('hello')).to.equal('hello');
    //etc
  });
});
```

This will allow the test suite to skip over it and it will list as 'pending' in your terminal on running `npm test`.

8. Practice using git from the command line by adding and committing your work frequently as you work through the exercises. Commit whenever you make something work - use commits to celebrate small victories.

9. When you are happy with your solutions, make a final commit and push the work to your Github.

10. Once you've completed these problems, <a href='https://us-central1-precourse-pushes.cloudfunctions.net/reviewme/?section=PRE-1' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>

11. The teaching team will provide feedback after reviewing your code, typically within 48 hours. Fix any issues with your solutions and apply these suggestions to this and subsequent sections.
